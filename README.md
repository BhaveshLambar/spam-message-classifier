# Spam Message Classifier (Mini Machine Learning Project)

## Project Overview
This project is a beginner-friendly machine learning application that classifies SMS messages as **Spam** or **Ham (Not Spam)**.

The goal of this project is to understand:
- How text data can be used in machine learning
- How classification models work
- How to evaluate and interpret model predictions

---

## Dataset
The project uses the **SMS Spam Collection Dataset**, which contains labeled SMS messages.

- Labels:
  - `spam` → Unwanted or promotional messages
  - `ham` → Normal messages

---

## Approach
1. Loaded and cleaned the dataset
2. Converted text messages into numerical features using **Bag of Words**
3. Trained a **Naive Bayes classifier**
4. Evaluated performance using accuracy and confusion matrix
5. Interpreted the model by analyzing important words

---

## Results
- Achieved high accuracy on unseen test data
- Successfully identified key spam-indicating words
- Demonstrated interpretable and explainable predictions

---

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
